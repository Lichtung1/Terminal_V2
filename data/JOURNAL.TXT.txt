Journal Entry - 03/15/1985:
Today, I successfully implemented the initial phase of the compression algorithm. The projection onto boundary manifolds shows promising results, with compression ratios exceeding expectations. However, encountered minor anomalies during data decoherence tests. Need to investigate further.

Journal Entry - 03/16/1985:
Continued testing with larger datasets. Noticed a consistent pattern in quantum state fluctuations. Speculating a connection with topological defects in the manifold structures. Will review literature on Jacob Bekenstein's entropy bounds.

Journal Entry - 03/17/1985:
Met with Dr. Bekenstein to discuss theoretical frameworks. He provided valuable insights into the implications of entropy constraints. Planned to incorporate his feedback into the compression algorithm.
